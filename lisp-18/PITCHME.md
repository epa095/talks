* Clojure

## Prefix notation

@ul
* fac(5) -> (fac 5)

* gcd(6,3) -> (gcd 6 3)

* 4 + 2 -> (+ 4 2)
 
* 4 + 2 + 6 -> (+ 4 2 6) 
  
* 4 + (6 / 2) -> (+ 4 (/ 6 2))
@ulend

## REPL examples

@ul
- ``` (+ (print 3) (print 4)) ```

- ``` (if t (print 3) (print 4)) ```

- (if nil (print 3) (print 4)) 
  
- (list 2 (+ 1 5) "a string")

- '(list 2 (+ 1 5) "a string") 
@ulend

+++

@ul
- ``` (eval '(list 2 (+ 1 5) "a string")) ```

- ```   `(list 2 ,(+ 1 5) "a string")  ```

- ```   `(list 2 ,(list 1 5) "a string") ```

- ``` `(list 2 ,@(list 1 5) "a string") ```

- ``` (progn (print "hello") (print "world")) ```
@ulend

+++

## QUIZ!

<!-- @ul -->
<!-- - ```  `(+ 2 ,(+ 1 5))  ``` -->

<!-- - ```  (eval `(+ 2 ,(+ 1 5) ) )  ``` -->

<!-- - ```  `(+ ,(+ 1 5) ,(+  2 (+ 3 4)))  ``` -->

<!-- - ```  `(+ ,(+ 1 5) `(+  2 ,(+ 3 4)))  ```  -->

<!-- - @ol -->
<!--    1. ```  (+ 6 `(+  2 7))  ``` -->

<!--    2. ```  (+ 6 9)  ``` -->

<!--    3. ```  (+ 6 `(+ 2 ,(+ 3 4)))  ``` -->

<!-- @olend -->

<!-- - ```  `(+ ,(+ 1 5) ,`(+  2 ,(+ 3 4)))  ``` -->

<!-- @olend -->


<!-- @ulend -->

<!-- @ul -->

<!-- - ```  (or (print "hello") (print " world"))  ``` -->

<!-- - ```  (loop for x in (list 1 4) collect (+ 2 x))  ``` -->

<!-- - ```  `(+ ,(loop for x in (list 3 4) collect (+ 2 x)))  ``` -->

<!-- - ```  `(+ ,@(loop for x in (list 3 4) collect (+ 2 x)))  ``` -->

<!-- - ```  `(+ ,@(loop for x in (list 3 4) collect `(+ 2 ,x))) ``` -->

## Lexical scoping

```Lisp
(defvar *X* 2)
  
(defun my-fun(var)
   (+ var *X*))

(let ((*X* 5)) 
  (my-fun 4))
```
-> 9
```
(my-fun 4)
```
-> 6

+++

Mostly seen with `*standard-output*`

## Test framework

We might start like this
```
(defun test-+ ()
  (and
    (= (+ 1 2) 3)
    (= (+ 1 2 3) 6)
    (= (+ -1 -3) -4)))

```

+++

But we want to know which of them failed...

```
(defun report-result (result form)
  (format t "~:[FAIL~;pass~] ... ~a~%" result form))

```

+++


```
(defun test-+ ()
  (report-result (= (+ 1 2) 3) '(= (+ 1 2) 3))
  (report-result (= (+ 1 2 3) 6) '(= (+ 1 2 3) 6))
  (report-result (= (+ -1 -3) -4) '(= (+ -1 -3) -4)))
```

+++
But we dont want to duplicate ourself.

```
(defmacro check (form)
  `(report-result ,form ',form))

```

```
(macroexpand-1 '(check (= (+ 1 2) 3)))

```
->
```
(REPORT-RESULT (= (+ 1 2) 3) '(= (+ 1 2) 3))
```

+++

```
(defun test-+ ()
  (check (= (+ 1 2) 3))
  (check (= (+ 1 2 3) 6))
  (check (= (+ -1 -3) -4))) 

```

+++
But pretty lame having to write "check" all the time.

```
(defun test-+ ()
  (check
    (= (+ 1 2) 3)
    (= (+ 1 2 3) 6)
    (= (+ -1 -3) -4)))

```

```

(PROGN
 (REPORT-RESULT (= (+ 1 2) 3) '(= (+ 1 2) 3))
 (REPORT-RESULT (= (+ 1 2 3) 6) '(= (+ 1 2 3) 6))
 (REPORT-RESULT (= (+ -1 -3) -4) '(= (+ -1 -3) -4)))
 

```

+++

```
(defmacro check (&body forms)
  `(progn 
    ,@(loop for f in forms collect `(report-result ,f ',f))))
```

+++
Now we can write
```
(defun test-+ ()
  (check
    (= (+ 1 2) 3)
    (= (+ 1 2 3) 6)
    (= (+ -1 -3) -4)))

```

+++
But what about the result value? It could indicate success/failure.

```
(defun report-result (result form)
  (progn
    (format t "~:[FAIL~;pass~] ... ~a~%" result form)
    result))

```

+++

Naive attempt at combining the results.
```
(defmacro check (&body forms)
  `(and
     ,@(loop for f in forms collect `(report-result ,f ',f))))
```

+++
We would want something like: 
```
(combine-results
  foo
  bar
  baz)
```
 -> 
```
(let ((result t))
  (if (not foo) (setf result nil))
  (if (not bar) (setf result nil))
  (if (not baz) (setf result nil))
  result)
  
```

+++

```
(defmacro combine-results (&body forms)
    `(let ((result t))
      ,@(loop for f in forms collect `(if (not ,f)  (setf result nil)))
      result))
```

+++
With combine-results we can write check properly
```
(defmacro check (&body forms)
  `(combine-results
     ,@(loop for f in forms collect `(report-result ,f ',f))))
```

+++

Let's define a failing test to see what happens

```
 (defun test-+ ()
      (check (= (+ 1 2) 3)
             (= (+ 1 2 3) 23)
             (= (+ -1 -3) -4)))
```

```
CL-USER> (test-+)
pass ... (= (+ 1 2) 3)
FAIL ... (= (+ 1 2 3) 23)
pass ... (= (+ -1 -3) -4)
NIL
```

+++
And a proper one

```
(defun test-+ ()
           (check (= (+ 1 2) 3)
             (= (+ 1 2 3) 6)
             (= (+ -1 -3) -4)))
```

```
CL-USER> (test-+)
pass ... (= (+ 1 2) 3)
pass ... (= (+ 1 2 3) 6)
pass ... (= (+ -1 -3) -4)
T
```

+++
We can even combine the tests

```
(defun test-* ()
  (check
    (= (* 2 2) 4)
    (= (* 3 5) 15)))
```

+++
And we can create test-suites!
```
(defun test-arithmetic ()
  (combine-results
   (test-+)
   (test-*)))
```

```
CL-USER> (test-arithmetic)
pass ... (= (+ 1 2) 3)
pass ... (= (+ 1 2 3) 6)
pass ... (= (+ -1 -3) -4)
pass ... (= (* 2 2) 4)
pass ... (= (* 3 5) 15)
T
```

+++
But that output is not very tidy with many tests...

```
(defvar *test-name* nil)

```

```
(defun report-result (result form)
  (progn
    (format t "~:[FAIL~;pass~] ... ~a: ~a~%" result *test-name* form)
    result))
```
+++

We can assign the name in each test...
```
(defun test-+ ()
(let ((*test-name* 'test-+))
       (check (= (+ 1 2) 3)
              (= (+ 1 2 3) 6)
              (= (+ -1 -3) -4))))

```
+++
But assigning the name in the tests are ugly, we want automation!

```
(deftest test-+ ()
       (check (= (+ 1 2) 3)
              (= (+ 1 2 3) 6)
              (= (+ -1 -3) -4)))
```
```
(defmacro deftest (name parameters &body body)
   `(defun ,name ,parameters
      (let ((*test-name* ',name))
      ,@body)))
```
+++
But what about the hierarchy of tests?

```
(defmacro deftest (name parameters &body body)
   `(defun ,name ,parameters
      (let ((*test-name* (append *test-name* (list ',name)) ))
      ,@body)))
```

# Why is Lisp loosing?
Three quotes by Peter Norvig:

+++

> I came to Python not because I thought it was a better/acceptable/pragmatic Lisp, but because it was better pseudocode

+++ 

> I think Lisp still has an edge for larger projects and for applications where the speed of the compiled code is important. But Python has the edge (with a large number of students) when the main goal is communication, not programming per se.

+++

> In terms of programming-in-the-large, at Google and elsewhere, I think that language choice is not as important as all the other choices: if you have the right overall architecture, the right team of programmers, the right development process that allows for rapid development with continuous improvement, then many languages will work for you; if you don't have those things you're in trouble regardless of your language choice.
