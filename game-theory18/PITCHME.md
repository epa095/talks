# Why Game Theory?
* It is fun!
* Also has some applications (e.g. understanding blockchains). 

# But what is it?

> [...] the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers

## Normative vs descriptive?

* Descriptive: Game theory gives reasonable scientific ideal models, similar to models used by physicists
*   * Underlying is an assumption of a "continuity" between the errors in the hyphotesises and errors in the conclusion.
* Normative: Game theory explains how rational decision makers ought to behave. 

# Prissoners dilemma

Originally formulated in 1950:

> Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of communicating with the other. The prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge, but they have enough to convict both on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the prosecutors offer each prisoner a bargain. Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to: betray the other by testifying that the other committed the crime, or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. The offer is:
>
> * If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves 2 years in prison
> * If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve 3 years in prison (and vice versa)
> * If A and B both remain silent, both of them will only serve 1 year in prison (on the lesser charge).


## Nash equilibrium

## This is game theory, but game theory is not this!


### Repeated games, finite/infinite/unbound


### perfect/inperfect information


### 1-n players

1.  Stochastic outcomes


### Pure vs randomized strategies


### sequential/simultaneous


# 2/3 of the average game


## 0 is the only pure strategy Nash Equilibrium.

## Several studies have demonstrated that the Nash equilibrium (and likewise, subgame perfect equilibrium) play is rarely observed. Instead, subjects regularly show partial cooperation, playing "R" (or "r") for several moves before eventually choosing "D" (or "d"). It is also rare for subjects to cooperate through the whole game.


## As with other games, for instance the ultimatum game, as the stakes increase the play approaches (but does not reach) Nash equilibrium play.[citation needed]
